This is basically a playground for game development. Maybe later it will evolve into a funny
game...?

## What is this, exactly?

Currently, this repo contains a shabby game development framework. I believe it's capable of 
doing very tiny and stupid games. Later I'll post one or two games in this framework as a proof.
